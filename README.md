# Module8 ETL Crowdfunding

## Purpose
Independent Funding has received a new dataset that contains information on the backers who have pledged money to the live projects. Utilizing Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks we need to extract and transform the new data into a CSV file to be uploaded into a new table in our crowdfunding database in SQL.
